let guess: u32 = guess.trim().parse().expect("Please type a number!");

match              -----A match expression is made up of arms. An arm consists of a pattern to match against, 
                        and the code that should be run if the value given to match fits that arm’s pattern

trim               -----The trim method on a String instance will eliminate any whitespace at the beginning and end,
                        The trim method eliminates \n or \r\n, resulting in just 5.
                
parse              -----The parse method on strings converts a string to another type

                        let guess: u32. The colon (:) after guess tells Rust we’ll annotate the variable’s type

                        parse will return same as Result the err and ok variant so we use .except with parse too
