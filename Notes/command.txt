cargo new dir_name        -------creates a directory with src and a .toml file 
cd dir_name

cargo build               ----it compiles the code and make a folder of "target" which contains exe file
target/debug/dir_name     ----this is the exe file


cargo run                 -----complies and run at the same time ---easy


cargo check               -----This command quickly checks your code to make sure it compiles but doesnâ€™t produce an executable   


cargo build --release     ------When your project is finally ready for release, you can use cargo build --release to compile it with optimizations. 
                                This command will create an executable in target/release instead of target/debug
            

Cargo.lock :              ------your project will remain at 0.8.5 until you explicitly upgrade

cargo update              ------which will ignore the Cargo.lock file and figure out all the latest versions that fit your specifications in Cargo.toml
